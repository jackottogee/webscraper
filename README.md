# webscraper

A library designed to demonstrate webscraping in Clojure.
This library scrapes the numbeo cost of living statistics, transforms them into something more readable, and outputs them to a CSV.
All data is owned by https://www.numbeo.com/, and is used to purely demonstrate the capabilities of Clojure.
